# HTML Tables IC

### Exercise 1:
Create a channel guide similar to what's shown in ```example4.png```. 

* Use Table Headers for each column
* Specify a default border
* When the User mouses over a TV show name cell, change the color of the table cell to a color of your choosing.

### Example 4
Create a portfolio for places to visit using the images in the ```ImagesForExample3``` directory that resembles the table in ```example_destinations.png```.

* Add 3 columens to the table: The picture of location, name of the location, rating (up to 5 stars) 
* Use Table Headers for each column

### CHALLENGE:
For both tables, use CSS to collapse borders, and add striping (different color) for every other row (Hint: nth-child), and any other style improvements you can think of.
